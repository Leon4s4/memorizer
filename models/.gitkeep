# Models Directory

This directory should contain the AI models for Memorizer Self-Contained.

## Required Models:

1. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2.gguf` (~90MB) - Embedding model
2. `tinyllama-1.1b-chat.gguf` (~600MB) - LLM model

## Download:

Run the download script from the parent directory:

```bash
cd ..
./download-models.sh
```

This will download both models into this directory.

## Note:

The actual .gguf files are NOT committed to git (too large).
Only this .gitkeep file is tracked to preserve the directory structure.
